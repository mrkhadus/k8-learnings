Create the docker file build the image on top of it.
# ~ docker build -t mrkhadus/kubeapp:first . 

push the image to the docker repository
# ~ docker push mrkhadus/kubeapp:first

Create the first 'Deployment' object in our kubernetes. 
# minikube start
# kubectl create deployment deployment-name --image=mrkhadus/kubeapp:first

to list the deployments
# kubectl get deployments

to list the pods 
# kubectl get pods

## All we done is just to create the deployment which will help us to attain the desired state of the pods.
## To expose the deployment to the outside world, we need to create the service.
